    <h2>Preperation Time</h2>
    <p>15 mins</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
      <li>
        Trim your Brussels by cutting off the little brown end. If there are any
        yellow leaves, pull them off. Cut any large ones in half. Add to a large
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel your sweet potato and chop into 1-2 inch pieces. Add to the large
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Smash 2 cloves of garlic and add it to the bowl.</li>
      <li>Pour 1/3 cup olive oil over the vegetables.</li>
      <li>Add cumin, garlic salt, salt, and pepper to taste. Stir to coat.</li>
      <li>(Line a large sheet pan with foil if you want super easy cleanup)</li>
      <li>
        Drizzle a little olive oil onto the sheet pan and rub it all over the
        pan (or foil) with your hand. Or you could spray it really well with
        nonstick spray.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the veggies onto the pan.</li>
      <li>
        Roast at 400 for about 40-45 minutes. The veggies are done when they are
        brown and a fork slides into them easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the veggies in a serving bowl and toss with 1-2 tablespoons red
        wine vinegar to taste. Garnish with fresh thyme if you want. Eat hot!
      </li>
    </ol>
