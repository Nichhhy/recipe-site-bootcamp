      <li>1 & 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon vanillar</li>
      <li>1 large egg/li></li>
      <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
      <li>1/2 cup to 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preperation Time</h2>
    <p>15 mins</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment
        paper or a silpat.
      </li>
      <li>Pull out 2 medium bowls, one for dry ingredients, one for wet.</li>
      <li>
        In one bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, baking powder, cinnamon,
        and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the butter in the other bowl. You don't have to melt it all the
        way, if there are a couple lumps it's okay. Let cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>Whisk in the vanilla, then the egg. Whisk in the honey..</li>
      <li>
        Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and use a wooden spoon to
        stir until it has just come together (don't overdo it).
      </li>
      <li>
        Save out about half of the chocolate chips. Use a sharp knife to roughly
        chop the remaining chocolate, then fold it into the dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refrigerate the dough for about 30 minutes, or freeze for about 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use your hands to shape the dough into roughly 15 cookies (or 12 if you
        eat a lot of dough like meâ€¦)
      </li>
      <li>Place on the prepared baking sheet about 2 inches apart.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-13 minutes, or until they have
        just started to brown on the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you remove them from the oven, immediately press the remaining
        chocolate chips into the tops of the cookies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let cool on the pan for a few minutes before removing to a cooling rack.
      </li>
      <li>Drink with lots of milk!</li>
    </ol>
