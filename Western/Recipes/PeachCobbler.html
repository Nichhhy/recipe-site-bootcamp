    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 pounds fresh sliced peaches, about 14 medium peaches</li>
      <li>1 & 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon oil</li>
      <li>1/3 cup all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom, or nutmeg</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preperation Time</h2>
    <p>30 mins</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>For the peach filling</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by preparing your peaches. Peel with a vegetable peeler if they
        are firm. If they are ripe, a vegetable peeler will bruise them so it's
        best to blanch: bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the peaches a
        few at a time so that they are totally submerged. Let boil for 30-45
        seconds. Remove from the boiling water. When they are cool enough to
        handle, use your hands to easily remove the peels. Slice the peaches.
        You should end up with about 9 cups of sliced peaches. Add your peaches
        to a 9Ã—13 inch casserole dish (no need to grease the pan).
      </li>
      <li>
        Top your peaches with 1 and 1/2 cups granulated sugar. You can use a
        little more sugar (up to 2 cups) if your peaches are under ripe. Or use
        about 1 and 1/4 cups sugar if they are super sweet.

        Top your peaches with 1 and 1/2 cups granulated sugar. You can use a
        little more sugar (up to 2 cups) if your peaches are under ripe. Or use
        about 1 and 1/4 cups sugar if they are super sweet.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>For the cobbler topping</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, add the dry ingredients: 2 and 1/2 cups flour, 1 and
        1/2 cups sugar, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon baking powder.
        Whisk it together.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, whisk together 1 egg and 1/2 cup buttermilk*. Pour it
        into the bowl with the flour, then use a pastry cutter to cut it into
        the flour, making a shaggy dough. You can use a spoon if you don't have
        a pastry cutter, be sure to use a cutting motion rather than stirring.
        It's okay if there are still some dry spots of flour, see photos. Pour
        the flour mixture on top of the peaches and spread around evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chop a stick of butter into 1/2 inch pieces. Scatter evenly over the top
        of the flour mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle 2 or 3 tablespoons sugar over the top. I used half granulated
        sugar and half demerara (raw) sugar to give it extra crunch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake at 375 for 45-55 minutes. The top should be turning light brown.
        Once it is light brown all over the top (not just in a few spots) and
        it's bubbling like crazy, it's done. I like to turn on my broiler and
        broil the cobbler for 1-3 minutes at this point. No need to move the
        oven rack up. It gives it an extra crisp browning that I just love. Who
        doesn't want a crispy crunchy top? But don't walk away! Keep an eye on
        it, I can't tell you how many things I've lit on fire in my broiler.
        Check it every 60 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are supposed to let it cool completely. Hogwash! Wait 15 minutes to
        let the juices set up and then dig in! Vanilla ice cream is pretty much
        essential for serving.
      </li>
      <li>Store leftovers covered on the counter.</li>
