      </li>
      <li>salt and pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon oil</li>
      <li>2 13.5-oz cans coconut milk , (lite coconut milk is great too)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons dried basil leaves</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>1 & 1/2 tablespoons yellow curry powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder, or 3/4 teaspoon</li>
      <li>1 large red onion, chopped</li>
      <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 jalapenos, seeded and finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water, COLD</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fresh ginger, grated or minced</li>
      <li>1/3 to 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preperation Time</h2>
    <p>15 mins</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Remove the skin from the chicken using your fingers and a serrated
        knife. Salt and pepper each thigh.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet to medium-high heat. Add 1 teaspoon oil (or you can
        use nonstick spray).
      </li>
      <li>
        When the oil is hot, add 3 chicken thighs. Don't put them too close
        together, you want to avoid steaming.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook for about 2 minutes, until nicely browned on the bottom. Then flip
        the chicken over to brown the other side for about 1-2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Remove the chicken to a plate.</li>
      <li>
        Repeat searing process with the other 3 chicken thighs. If there is
        still enough grease in the pan then you don't need to add more oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a crock pot combine coconut milk, basil, 2 teaspoons salt,
        3/4 teaspoon pepper, yellow curry, and chili powder (to taste). Stir to
        combine.
      </li>
      <li>Add the chopped red onions, garlic, and jalapenos.</li>
      <li>Add the browned chicken and stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Cook on high for 4-5 hours, or on low for 6-8 hours.</li>
      <li>
        Remove the chicken from the slow cooker and transfer to a plate or
        cutting board. Let cool for a couple minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Add the ginger to the slow cooker.</li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, combine cornstarch and 1 tablespoon COLD water. Stir
        until it's not lumpy. Add this to the crock pot and stir.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shred the chicken, removing the bones and any tough bits. It should just
        be falling apart.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the meat to the slow cooker and stir. Return the lid and cook for
        another 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the cilantro.</li>
      <li>Serve with rice, cauliflower rice, or naan.</li>
    </ol>
